/*For the final project you will be creating an automated version
of the classic card game WAR! There are many versions of the game
WAR.In this version there are only 2 players.
You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie in a
round.
Think about how you would build this project and write your plan
down. Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as
what properties and methods they may include.
Four suits to represent the appearance (user interface - ui) for
your cards.
let cardSuits = ["Spades üó°Ô∏è", "Hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è", "Diamonds üíé",
"Clubs üçÄ"];
console.log("Card Suits Example:", cardSuits);
The game itself will automatically play using console.log() to
display turns, points, cards used, and the outcome of the game.
No user input via prompts is required.

The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
1. Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
2. Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
3. The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point.
  -Ties result in zero points for both Players.
4. After all cards have been played, display the score and declare
the winner.

/*Make a class for the Dealer:

start(): while loop for user to start game,
instantiate 2 players, instantiate and build deck,
give 26 cards to each Player, loop through all 26 cards and 
determine which value is higher then assign 1 point to winning
card of Player 1 or Player 2, Display winner - the higher score.
note: could separate into multiple methods.
